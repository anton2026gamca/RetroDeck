Firstly I chose what main parts will I need for this project:
  - a "computer"
  - a display
  - a battery
  - a gamepad
  - a case

I want the console to have some compute power, maybe I will want to run more advanced games on it in the future.
I already have a [Raspberry Pi CM5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-5), [5 inch display](https://www.elecrow.com/rc050s-hdmi-5-inch-800x480-capacitive-touch-monitor-built-in-speaker-with-backlight-control.html?idd=6) and [PiSugar 3 Plus](https://www.pisugar.com/products/pisugar-3-plus-raspberry-pi-ups) laying around, so I've decided to use those in this project. The gamepad will be built in to the case. I will design that later.

Because I went with the Raspberry Pi CM5, I will need to design an IO board. I started with a schematic, I downloaded the [official raspberry pi cm5 IO board design files](https://rpltd.co/cm5io-design-files) for reference. I don't have any experience with designing PCBs yet.

I started laying out the components. I precisely measured the distances on my 5 inch screen and drew its outline.
